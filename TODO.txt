Before first release:

1) Fix or hide pico 8 system
2) Fix or hide media system
3) Fix or hide ports system
4) Something of a readme
5) Test available cores for all systems... remove those that never work.

Decisions to make:
1) Are we happy with the current Emu/Roms folder setup? Are there any more to combine or split out? Do we want the names to remain the same?
2)

"Would be nice"s:
1) Scraper app?
2) dufs
3) syncthing
4)
