Before first release:

1) Fix or hide pico 8 system
2) Fix or hide media system
3) Fix or hide ports system
4) Something of a readme
5) Get PyUI to reflect system volume
6) Fix or hide contrast, color temp, etc. in PyUI
7) Test available cores for all systems... remove those that never work.
8)

Decisions to make:
1) Do we want to have ssh and adb start up every time for all users, or limit it to a developer mode type thing? Should we leave these as apps?
2) Are we happy with the current Emu/Roms folder setup? Are there any more to combine or split out? Do we want the names to remain the same?
3)

"Would be nice"s:
1) Scraper app?
2) Reboot option in PyUI settings
3) Implement emu core overrides into standard_launch.sh
4)
