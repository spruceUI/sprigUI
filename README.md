## What is sprigUI?
sprig is a custom operating system for the Miyoo Mini Flip, developed by the spruceOS team. Our aim with this project is to find a niche somewhere between the intentional simplicity of MinUI and the more visually-oriented user interfaces of OnionOS or spruceOS.

## Features:

- Custom Python-based frontend that can shapeshift between the visual styles of Miyoo's MainUI, Daijisho, MinUI, or even EmulationStation, courtesy of chrisj951.

- Over 60 supported emulated systems, ranging from retro favorites like the Game Boy, to modern fantasy and homebrew consoles such as Pico-8 and GameTank.

- Over-the-air updates to make updating your device a snap.

- Apps borrowed from our friends on the Onion and MinUI teams, including a file manager, ebook reader, bootlogo flasher, and more.

- sprigUI automatically enables wireless ADB and SSH access on boot. You can connect to your device using these services by running the following commands from your computer.
    - ADB: `adb connect 192.168.x.x:5555`
    - SSH: `ssh root@192.168.x.x`
